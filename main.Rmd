# Abstract
Recently, the variability ratio (VR) effect statistic [defined in @hedges1995sex; and proposed in @nakagawa2015meta]
has been used [see
@senior2016meta;
@brugger2017heterogeneity;
@winkelbeiner2019evaluation; @mccutcheon2019efficacy; @pillinger2019meta;

]
in order to study treatment effect heterogeneity (TEH) and differences in variation between two groups.
While a VR that is different from one
is widely acknowledged to implicate an individual treatment effect the exact
relationship between those two quantities is not discussed in detail. 

The purpose of this note is to derive a precise connection between the TEH and the VR. 
We derive an analytical equation that connects the two.
Moreover, we provide an example simulation for which VR is equal to
one and there exist TEH.  

# Individual treatment effect

The treatment effect of individual $i$ with respect to a given (medical) treatment is defined as 

$$\delta_i = Y_{i}^1 - Y_{i}^0,$$

where $Y_{i}^a$ denotes the potential outcome of individual $i$ with respect to
treatment $a \in \{0,1\}$. The potential outcome $Y_i^a$ represents the outcome that
the individual $i$ *would have* had, had the individual $i$ received the treatment $a$, irrespective of
the *factual* treatment, the treatment that actually *was* received by the individual.
Moreover, the notation reflects the fact that we make the SUTVA assumption,
which allows us to write the potential outcomes for an individual $i$
as a function of the individual's own treatment assignment alone rather
than the treatment assignment of all individuals in the population.
Mathematically, $Y_i^{a_1,...,a_i, ...} \equiv Y_i^{a_i}$.
This assumption is not always valid. In case the treatment refers to a vaccination against
a disease the assumptions is violated,
since the effect of a potential vaccination of an individual $i$ depends on whether others have been vaccinated.

The *fundamental problem of causal inference* [see @holland1986statistics], states that we can never
observe both $Y_{i}^1$ and $Y_{i}^0$ at the same time.

In the following we consider the so called super-population perspective, in which we view our
sample $Y_{i}^0, Y_{i}^1$ of size $N$ as a random sample from an infinite population.
More formally, we consider $Y_i^a$ to be realizations of a population level random variable $Y^a$.
Similarly, $\delta_i$ are realizations of a population level random variable $\delta$.

In summary, there are two levels of randomness that we consider.
Firstly, we randomly draw individuals $i=1, ..., N$ from an infinite population,
each individual having associated a pair $(Y_i^0, Y_i^1)$ of potential outcomes.
Secondly, a predetermined number ($0 < N_1 < N$) of individuals get randomly assigned
to treatment ($a=1$), the remaining ($N_0=N-N_1$) individuals get assigned to the
control ($a=0$) group, and the associated outcomes $Y_i=Y_i^a$ are observed.
The uncertainty in any type of estimate that results from these two levels of randomness may be referred to
as sampling-based and design-based uncertainty, respectively [see @abadie2020sampling].


We mention that there is an additional layer of randomness that might be considered.
We could assume that for each individual $i$, $Y_{i}^a$ are random variables rather than mere
realizations of a population level random variable $Y^a$.
In this case one might refer to $\delta_i$ as the random treatment effect of the individual $i$.
Realizations $y_i^a$ of $Y_{i}^a$ could be viewed as draws from
a "*metaphorical population*, comprising the possible eventualities that
might have occurred but mainly didn't" [see @spiegelhalter2019art]. Alternatively,
the source for this part of the randomness could be a model for measurement error,
epistemological uncertainty,
or could reflect the assumption that the individual $i$ has a *truly* random outcome.


## Treatment effect heterogeneity
Treatment effect heterogeneity (TEH) is present if not all individuals have the same individual
treatment effect, i.e. $\delta_i$ is not the same for all individuals.
In the language of the super-population perspective this means that
$Var(\delta) > 0$. Of course, in any practical situation it is impossible *not* to have TEH.
The more interesting question to study is the question about the degree or the magnitude of TEH.
This can be quantified by estimating the magnitude of $Var(\delta)$ or by identifying a relevant
(w.r.t. the application at hand) subgroup $X$ of the population for which $E[\delta|X] - E[\delta]$
is large.


In the case of random individual treatment effect, TEH could be defined as the
 variation between individuals of the average random individual treatment effect ($E[\delta_i]$).


Due to the fundamental problem of causal inference it is not straightforward to measure
the degree of TEH for a given treatment and population.

## Variability Ratio 
We define the *variability ratio* $\nu$ [cf. @hedges1995sex] as
$$\nu = \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_0},$$
where $\sigma_a^2 = Var(Y^a)$, for $a=0,1$, are the super-population variances.


For the case of sufficiently large sample sizes $N_0, N_1$,
sufficiently large values $\sigma_a$ and (approximately) normally distributed $\ln \sigma_a$,
an unbiased estimator of $\ln\nu$ and its sample variance
[cf. @raudenbush1987examining; @nakagawa2015meta]
are given by
\begin{align*}
\ln VR & = \ln\left(\frac{s_1}{s_0}\right) + \frac{1}{2(N_1-1)} - \frac{1}{2(N_0-1)} \\
s^2_{\ln VR} & = \frac{1}{2(N_1-1)} - \frac{1}{2(N_0-1)}.
\end{align*}
Here $s_0$ and $s_1$ denote the finite sample variances of treatment and control units' observed scores $Y_i$.

# Treatment effect heterogeneity and variability ratio
In order to derive the main analytical relationship between TEH and the VR effect size
we consider two time points $t=0$ (baseline) and $t=1$ (endpoint).
We denote by $Y_{it}^a$ the potential outcomes of individual $i$ at time $t$ with respect to the treatment $a$.
We assume that $Y_{i0}^0=Y_{i0}^1$, i.e. there is no effect at baseline.
Then, we may write

\begin{align*}
Y_{i1}^a 
& = Y_{i0}^a + (Y_{i1}^0 - Y_{i0}^a) + a \cdot (Y_{i1}^1 - Y_{i1}^0) \\
& = Y_{i0}^0 + (Y_{i1}^0 - Y_{i0}^0) + a \cdot (Y_{i1}^1 - Y_{i1}^0)
\quad\text{(assuming that $Y_{i0}^0 \equiv Y_{i0}^1$)} \\
& =^{def} \alpha_i + \tau_i + a \cdot \delta_i.
\end{align*}

In words, this means that we can decompose the
potential outcome score $Y_{i1}^a$ of individual $i$ at endpoint ($t=1$)
under treatment $a$ as the sum of the following quantities (Figure 1):

- the baseline score (aka the pre-treatment score) of individual $i$
- the temporal change of score (aka the response) of individual $i$ under control
- the treatment effect of individual $i$ in case $a=1$ and zero otherwise. 

![Decomposition of the potential outcomes $Y_1^a$.](images/decomposition.png)

We then have for the difference in variance in temporal change

\begin{align}\label{raweq}
Var(Y_{1}^1 - Y_{0}^1) - Var(Y_{1}^0 - Y_{0}^0)
& = Var(\delta) + 2Cov(\tau, \delta) \nonumber \\
& = Var(\delta) + 2\rho \,Var(\tau)^\frac{1}{2}Var(\delta)^\frac{1}{2}.
\end{align}

Here $\rho$ denotes the correlation between $\tau$, the change (or response) score under control,
and $\delta$, the treatment effect.
Note that this quantity is not observable since it contains information about the
correlation between both potential outcomes $Y_1^0$ and $Y_1^1$.

## Compatible values of TEH and VR
With equation (\ref{raweq}) at hand, we are ready to derive restrictions
on the standard deviation $\sigma_{\delta} = Var(\delta)^\frac{1}{2}$ of the treatment effect $\delta$.


Let $\nu$ be the variability ratio defined with respect to the response variables $Y^a = Y_{1}^a - Y_{0}^a$.
Then, we have that
\begin{align}\label{maineq}
\nu^2 - 1
& = \frac{Var(Y_{1}^1 - Y_{0}^1) - Var(Y_{1}^0 - Y_{0}^0)}{Var(Y_{1}^0 - Y_{0}^0)} \nonumber\\
& =  \frac{ Var(\delta) + 2\rho \,Var(\tau)^\frac{1}{2}Var(\delta)^\frac{1}{2} }{Var(\tau)}\nonumber\\
& =  \frac{ \sigma_{\delta}^2  + 2\rho \,\sigma_\tau \sigma_{\delta}}{\sigma_\tau^2}\nonumber\\
& =  \frac{1}{\sigma_\tau^2}(\sigma_{\delta} + \rho \,\sigma_\tau)^2  - \rho^2 .
\end{align}


Now set $r := \nu^2 - 1$, then we see that we must have that $r\geq -\rho^2$, and we may write
$|\sigma_{\delta} + \rho\, \sigma_\tau | = \sigma_\tau \sqrt{r+ \rho^2}$. Hence, we have the following
compatible values for $\sigma_\delta$ 

$$
\begin{cases}
\sigma_{\delta} = \sigma_\tau (\sqrt{r+ \rho^2} - \rho)
    ;& r \geq 0 \\
\sigma_{\delta} = 
    \sigma_\tau (\pm\sqrt{r+ \rho^2} - \rho) 
    ; & \rho \leq 0 \quad \text{and}\quad  -\rho^2 \leq r \leq 0 .
\end{cases}
$$

It is interesting to observe that for negative values of $r$ (or equivalently, $\nu <1$)
there are two possible solutions for $\sigma_\delta$ as visualized in figures
(3) and (4).

![Variability ratio $\nu$ against relative treatment effect heterogeneity
$\frac{\sigma_\delta}{\sigma_\tau}$ for different levels of assumed correlation $\rho$.](images/fixed_rho_curves.png)


Since the quantities $r$ and $\sigma_\tau$ are estimable from data,
the main equation (\ref{maineq}) implies the following bound on $\sigma_\delta$.

$$
\sigma_{\delta} \leq \sigma_\tau (1+ \sqrt{1+r}).
$$

If we are willing to make assumptions on the values of $\rho$,
e.g. through domain knowledge, this estimate can be improved.
In case $\rho=0$ we have that

$$
\sigma_{\delta} = \sigma_\tau \sqrt{r}.
$$

![Compatible region of $\rho$ and $\frac{\sigma_\delta}{\sigma_\tau}$ assuming $0.87 < \nu < 1.1$.](
images/compatible_area_bound.png
)

In a Bayesian interpretation, we may put a distribution on the values of
$\rho$ representing our belief about the true value of $\rho$, which in turn
defines a probability distribution around the values of $\sigma_{\delta}$.

# Conclusion
The variability ratio (VR) effect statistic [defined in @hedges1995sex; and proposed in @nakagawa2015meta]
has been used extensively in order to study treatment effect heterogeneity (TEH) in clinical studies.
While a VR that is different from one is widely acknowledged to implicate an individual treatment effect
the exact relationship between those two quantities is not discussed in detail. 

In this note we derived an analytic expression that connects the VR and the
standard deviation of the treatment effect.

We showed that in case that the variability is equal to $1$,
the standard deviation of the treatment effect is at most twice the size of the standard deviation
of the response under placebo.
Moreover, if one is willing to make assumptions on the non-negativity of an unobserved
quantity this implies a constant treatment effect.
We illustrated our finding with visualizations and a simulation.
